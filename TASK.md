## Personality Integration

The personality integration feature allows aider to add unique flair to GitHub interactions based on a user-defined personality. This feature uses LLM to generate contextually appropriate, personality-driven content while preserving the original message.

### Integration Points
Commands to enhance with personality:
- `/prcomment` - When adding comments to PRs
- `/prupdate` - When updating PR progress
- `/comment` - When commenting on issues
- `/pr` - When creating PR descriptions
- `/update` - When updating issues

Methods in GitHubIssueClient:
- `create_pr_comment()` - Add flair to PR comments
- `create_issue_comment()` - Style issue comments
- `update_pr_progress()` - Enhance progress updates
- `create_pull_request()` - Add personality to PR descriptions
- `update_issue()` - Style issue updates

### Scope
- PR Comments: Add personality to comments on pull requests
- Issue Comments: Style issue comments with personality
- PR Progress Updates: Include personality in progress tracking
- PR Descriptions: Add flair to initial PR descriptions
- Issue Updates: Style issue updates with personality

### Implementation
- [x] PersonalityManager class to handle personality loading and application
- [x] LLM integration for generating personality-driven content
- [x] Configuration via .aider.conf.yml and personality repository
- [x] Fallback mechanisms for graceful degradation
- [x] Context-aware personality application

### Configuration
Users can define their personality by:
1. Creating a personality repository with a README.md
2. Configuring personality settings in .aider.conf.yml:
   ```yaml
   github:
     personality:
       enabled: true
   ```
3. Using `/personality toggle` to enable/disable at runtime

### Error Handling
- [x] Graceful fallback to original content on LLM failures
- [x] Maximum length limits for personality additions (comments should be brief enough to not distract from the content)
- [x] Rate limiting consideration for LLM calls
- [x] Retry strategy for failed LLM requests

### Testing Strategy
- [x] Personality mechanism verified in test_github_integration.py
- [x] Integration points tested through existing GitHub client tests

### User Experience
- [x] `/personality toggle` to enable/disable temporarily
- [x] Clear feedback when personality is applied (âœ¨ indicator)
