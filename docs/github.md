# GitHub Integration

Aider provides seamless integration with GitHub through pull request creation, issue management, and customizable personalities.

## Personality

Aider can apply a custom personality to your GitHub interactions (PR descriptions, comments, etc). The personality is loaded from your personal `personality` repository on GitHub.

### Setup

1. Create a repository named `personality` in your GitHub account
2. Add a `README.md` file that describes your desired personality
3. The personality will be automatically applied to all GitHub interactions

Example `README.md`:
```markdown
You are a friendly and professional assistant who:
- Uses clear and concise language
- Adds relevant emojis ðŸŽ¯
- Maintains a positive tone
```

### Configuration

You can control the personality feature through:

1. Environment variable: `AIDER_PERSONALITY_ENABLED=true|false`
2. Configuration file: `.aider.conf.yml`

Example `.aider.conf.yml`:
```yaml
github:
  personality:
    enabled: true
```

### Testing

To test the personality feature:

1. Set up required environment variables (pick a good free model from `model_prices.py`):
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key
   export AIDER_TEST_MODEL=gemini/gemini-2.0-flash-exp
   ```

2. Run the integration tests:
   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_github_integration.py -r A --verbosity=2 --log-cli-level=INFO
   ```

The tests will create a temporary GitHub repository and verify that your personality is correctly applied to:
- PR descriptions
- Issue comments
- Progress updates

## Configuration

### GitHub Token

You can configure your GitHub token in three ways (in order of precedence):

1. Direct token input when initializing the client
2. Environment variable: `GITHUB_TOKEN`
3. Configuration file: `.aider.conf.yml`

Example `.aider.conf.yml`:
```yaml
github:
  token: your_github_token
  rate_limit:
    max_per_page: 100
    default_per_page: 30
```

2. Full GitHub URL:
```
/prupdate https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 Fixed bug Y
```

The progress will be tracked in a single comment that gets updated with each change, including timestamps.

## Rate Limiting

Rate limits can be configured in `.aider.conf.yml`:

```yaml
github:
  rate_limit:
    max_per_page: 100    # Maximum items per page (max: 100)
    default_per_page: 30 # Default items per page
```

The client will automatically respect these limits when making API requests.
